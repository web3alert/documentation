# What is Web3alert?

It is a service that tracks **on-chain events** in blockchains and allows users to receive notifications about these events in **messengers** (for example, Telegram/Discord/Slack and other channels).

Web3alert scans new blocks in blockchain networks, and whenever the requested event happens, Web3alert sends a message to the user.

## How Web3alert works

A user creates a rule defining which event one wants to be notified about. As soon as the desired event happens, the user receives an alert in the selected messenger.

All the process answers the following questions:

* Where to track? In which [project](https://app.gitbook.com/o/zr7hrTPPcDEkQT4xhGsQ/s/59TU8Qy9VGiP40WV4wM1/\~/revisions/Jsd7Da5YlmYfxuBWm7b8/concepts/projects) (network, protocol, dapp)?
* What to track? Which [trigger](https://app.gitbook.com/o/zr7hrTPPcDEkQT4xhGsQ/s/59TU8Qy9VGiP40WV4wM1/\~/revisions/Jsd7Da5YlmYfxuBWm7b8/concepts/triggers) (event, call, or set of events from template)?
* What to [filter](https://app.gitbook.com/o/zr7hrTPPcDEkQT4xhGsQ/s/59TU8Qy9VGiP40WV4wM1/\~/revisions/Jsd7Da5YlmYfxuBWm7b8/concepts/filters)? For example, if only events for a certain address or certain value are needed.
* Where to send a message? To which [messenger](https://app.gitbook.com/o/zr7hrTPPcDEkQT4xhGsQ/s/59TU8Qy9VGiP40WV4wM1/\~/revisions/Jsd7Da5YlmYfxuBWm7b8/concepts/messengers)?

Once you create a subscription, it is displayed on the page of the selected Project and also on the My Alerts page, where it can be edited.
