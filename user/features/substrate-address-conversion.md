# Substrate address conversion

User has to set up a subscription in each network manually. But there is a feature to make it easier - **address conversion**. When the user sets up a subscription in any substrate network and gives a name to some substrate address, the address is converted to the appropriate address for that network and is also saved in address book for all Substrate networks.

**Example 1**: Alice sets up a Kusama subscription, but provided a Polkadot address. Alice gave this address a name - my wallet 1. Web3alert will not show the conversion on the screen, but when you click "save subscription" the address will be converted into Kusama format and the subscription will work as intended.

**Example 2**: Alice saved the address during setup of some Substrate network subscription like in example 1. Let's say she named the address "**my wallet**". Now, Alice can go to Bifrost and setup a subscription there. She will see the option to choose "**my wallet**" and it will have an address in Bifrost format.
