# Smart contracts

Certain networks support an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM); thus, smart contracts might be built on top of these networks. With Web3alert, users can conveniently monitor any smart contract and associated events/calls.

To get started, simply input the contract's address and assign it a name, and it will appear as a module.

### How to import smart contracts

**Step 1**: Pick the Smart Contract category from the list of trigger categories.

**Step 2:** Enter the smart contract address and assign it a name so that it can be displayed as a module within the associated network.

**Step 3:** Once the smart contract is displayed as a module, you can use its events and calls as triggers to create an alert.
