# Log in

The use of Web3alert begins with logging in. Currently, the only option for logging into your account is via **Telegram messenger**. However, what if you want to explore Web3alert before logging in just to determine if this crypto-alerting service is right for you? The good news is that there is a "view-only" mode available ("Let me check it out first" button), allowing you to navigate the interface and understand how it works. The bad news is that in this "view-only" mode, any progress you make cannot be saved, and you will have to start from the beginning once you log in.

When the user clicks the "Log in with Telegram" button, they will be redirected to the Web3alert Telegram bot. From there, they can use the "Start" button or the "/login" command to obtain a unique link that will take them to their **"My alerts"** dashboard. This is a one-time process, and the browser will retain the login session.
