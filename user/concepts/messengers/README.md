# Messengers

Users can receive notifications in various messengers:

* in Telegram chat with the Web3alert bot,
* in Discord (you can have a few Discord destinations for the separation of notifications),
* in Slack,
* via Webhook (JSON-payload to to communicate with external systems, [more on that here](https://docs.web3alert.io/user-docs/concepts/messengers/webhooks))

In the future, there will be more ways to receive notifications.
