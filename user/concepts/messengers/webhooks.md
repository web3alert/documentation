# Webhooks

Webhooks are a powerful feature that allows our application to communicate with external systems in real-time. When certain events occur within our application, such as a new user registration or an order update, a POST request is sent to a specified URL endpoint. This request contains a JSON-formatted payload, which encapsulates relevant data about the event.
