# FAQ

#### **Does Web3alert support account derivation? E.g. if I subscribe to the parent Polkadot account (e.g. 5â€¦.) will Web3alert also monitor the derived account on Acala or Astar?**

No, you have to set up a subscription in each network manually. But there is a feature to make it easier - [address conversion](../features/substrate-address-conversion.md).

#### Is there any chance that we can get a notification if a balance updates - some treasuries follow some weird governance processes and just set balances so it would be great if we can get a notification if the balanace today has changed from the balance yesterday (even if no transfer event can be found?)

Not yet, but we are have that feature in plans at around Q2 2023.
